  <h4> Sports are an enormous part of our modern world. They not only physically keep people in shape but also create communities and foster a sense of global interaction, from rivalry to friendship. They also have acted as a crutch, a force of reflecting and pushing change. However, change is often slow, and unfortunately not discussed enough.</h4>

<p class="text">
  <p> For my Data and Journalism 221 final project, I wanted to examine the disparities in male and female varsity sports teams at in two New York State universities. These include Syracuse University and Cornell University, which are two private research universities of similar enrollment (around 15,000 students). The comparisons between the two schools’ athletic programs will be compared based on the teams Syracuse has due to the fact Cornell has several other varsity sports teams not offered at SU. This data was provided by the U.S. Department of Education or the EADA, “The Equity in Athletic Data Analysis”. 
 </p>

  <br>

  <p> Although Syracuse University has made strides in recent decades there is a clear gap in representation and funding for female sports. The most evident difference between the two is the immense operating expense budget for the varsity football team, which exceeds any other sport at $3,347,678. It almost overshadows the entire operating expense budget for all female Syracuse University varsity sports teams. In contrast, the highest female operating variety team by expense is the basketball team. They are spending a total of $1,622,997, less than half of the male varsity football budget. Basketball, the second-highest and most dominant male sport, also contains an incredibly substantial budget of $2,386,977.  </p>

</script>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>Finally, the operating expenses budget for male sports is almost double that of females, at $7,253,435. This only includes five varsity sports teams. Whereas the female operating expense budget is $4,397,811 for ten varsity sports. That is over a $2,855,624 difference, clearly favoring men’s sports. This is unacceptable and furthers the divide of inequality.

<p> In comparison at Cornell University, there is a clear attempt to reflect diversity and gender equality in its varsity sports teams. Although similar to Syracuse University, the Cornell University football operating expenses are substantially high with no female team, the basketball and soccer male and female teams operating expenses are much more similar. Cornell additionally has more female athletes than males, this is not true of Syracuse. Cornell University additionally has several other sports teams available to men and women, including, baseball, equestrian, fencing, golf, gymnastics, sailing, squash, swimming, and diving, as well as wrestling.

</script>

<br>
<br>


<p>The operating expense total is much closer in range for male and female varsity sports at Cornell as well, accounting for $1,719,148 for men's sports and $1,235,393 for women's sports. However, there is still room for growth for Cornell as the total for male varsity operating sports receives $483,755 more.

 <p>Although Cornell University is an Ivy League School, the standards for sports and gender equality should be the same everywhere. Fostering gender equality in athletic programs is vital in encouraging a more equal and fair atmosphere. Equity in athletics is essential as sports unite people, and like all constructs that unite people, they should truthfully reflect our diverse reality.</p>
